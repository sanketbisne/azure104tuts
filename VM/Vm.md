In this Lab , we will create a virtual machine in azure 
Before Creating a Virtual machine Lets take a look over Some Basic Concepts

Choose any plan as per your requirement

Basic Tier ( For Dev / Test Workloads )
Standard Tier ( For Production Workloads )

> Step 1. Click on free Trial

> Step 2. Select a Resource group 

Resource group is like a container where all the resources can be stored 
Suppose in our company there are multiple Departments so it will be easily to manage among this.

> Step 3. Choose the Disktype

There are 3 versions availabel
-Standard HDD
-Standard SSD
-Premium SSD

> Step 4. Networking
You can choose among Virtual network , subnet, public ip address and NSG(network security groups)
to allow which port to allow to enhance security of your instance

> Step 5 . Guest Config 

If suppose you have to Write automated script as soon as vm launches for eg: say if you want to launch a Apache web server then you can write a script inside the text space provided.

> Step 6. Tags

By Tags we can give the name to our Virtual machine
say VM Name is Server1

7. Review and Create

You are now able to see the Virtual machine Deployed under Resources Group section
